            I’ve worn different professional hats throughout my career that reflect my varied interests: from selling custom high-end bikes, to communications coordinator for an arts non-profit,
            to  construction coordinator for a famous video game studio. The one thing they all have in common is a certain element of creation.
            <br>

            As a Communications and Cultural Studies major in university, my main area of interest revolved around the study of new technology
            and its impact on the way we live and make meaning of our lives.
            During and post-university period, I focused on writing and managing other people’s creative projects. I eventually developed an itch to be less of a spectator and more of a builder.
            As a means to reconcile my need for a creative outlet with my interest in the wide world of technology, I dived head first into learning how to code in the summer of 2015.

            As a software developer, I’m just as interested in developing my skills relating to elements of design, UI, and UX(traditionally referred to as the front-end) as
            the secret-voodoo-magic stuff that happens underneath(traditionally referred to as the back-end).
            <br>
            <br>
            When I’m not in front of my computer, you can find me in the midst of a lip-sync battle, hanging out at the museum or biking around the city.
