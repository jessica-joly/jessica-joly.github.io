          <p class="large text-muted"> Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with a particular preference for developing front-end and design skills.
            My interests have always revolved around exploring the intersection between art, culture and technology. (Fun side note: my first language is French, and I was an elite competitive cyclist in my former life.)
            Unsatisfied as a cultural spectator, I became a builder. Coding has become my creative outlet, combining art and technology into a functional skill.
