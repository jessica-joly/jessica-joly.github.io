                        My interests have always revolved around exploring the intersection between art, culture and technology. (Fun side note: my first language is French, and I was an elite competitive cyclist in my former life.)
                        Unsatisfied as a cultural spectator, I became a builder. Coding has become my creative outlet, combining art and technology into a functional skill.
