description: Hip Hiking features some of Washington State's best hikes for the hip explorers. The goal of the project was to get more practice working with the Ember framework and the Google API.<br>The application allows users to contribute to a repertoire of hikes by adding hike reports. Every hike is featured on the index page and users can click on each to get more information including description, distance, level of difficulty, area etc., On this page, users can also leave a review for the hike including a rating.
