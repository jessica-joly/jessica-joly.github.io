description: We created the Missed Connections application to offer users a more personalized experience with the missed connections section of Craigslist. Users can log into their own missed connections page and create keywords to search the Craigslist database. When the search is run, it will return useable links that match their user-specific keywords. Users can view the body text and visit the source material if desired. Ideally, it would run on a server constantly, update the list of connections, and notify the user when new connections appear based on their keywords.
