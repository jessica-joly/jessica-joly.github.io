description: Transcending Coffee is a blog application with posts regarding various caffeine subjects. The posts are pre-populated with data from a coffee lorem ipsum generator. Users can also create/update/delete posts and add comments to each. We built this project as an exercise to learn the ins and outs of the Ember framework.
