description: Pop Portland! is a fictional music festival that celebrates both local and international emerging musical acts. The festival app aims to be a one-stop shop of information for festival goers. Users can peruse each act's information page which includes a Soundcloud music sample. They can also see all of a band's events and get all of the venue information(including Google Maps location) for said events. When signed-in, users can also tag events as favorites and add them to their profile page.
