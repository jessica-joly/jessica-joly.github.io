description: With the goal of developing my design skills combined with my love for all things music, I created an app for a fictional music festival. The app aims to be a one-stop shop of information for festival goers. Users can peruse each act's information page which includes a Soundcloud music sample. They can also see all of a band's events and get all of the venue information(including Google Maps location) for said events. When signed-in, users can also tag events as favorites and add them to their profile page.
